    "description": "The tab_tier is an extension for managing date-based table partitions. Unlike most existing systems that use triggers to automatically relocate data, this extension relies on a job to call a maintenance procedure that moves applicable data when invoked. Combined with an allocation function that provisions new partitions, this module can handle up to daily granularity.",
